tool main axis 8 selective directional drilling or straight drilling can thus be achieved in a simple manner by locking or turning the rotary table 5 and hence the drill string 4 and housing 3 by arranging the point of intersection of the rotational axis 16 with the tool main axis 8 to be near to the rotary drill bit 13 the bore hole widens only slightly when operating in the straight drilling mode and compared with the directional drilling operation mode because of the eccentric movement of the rotary drill bit 13 the amount of bore hole widening corresponds to about twice the value of the axial displacement 27 between the rotational axis 16 and the main tool axis 8 in the area of the rotary drill bit 13 this axial displacement 27 is also referred to as offset the offset 27 can be reduced to zero if an eccentric stabiliser is used instead of the centric stabiliser 14 shown in fig2 the eccentricity of the eccentric stabiliser is arranged to compensate for the offset fig3 shows

invention and that the same sfc geometric principle can be applied in an innovative way to all the well known prior art configurations more examples are given in fig1 16 17 and 18 fig1 describes another preferred embodiment of an sfc antenna it consists on an aperture antenna said aperture being characterized by its sfc perimeter said aperture being impressed over a conducting ground plane or ground counterpoise 34 said ground plane of ground counterpoise consisting for example on a wall of a waveguide or cavity resonator or a part of the structure of a motor vehicle such as a car a lorry an airplane or a tank the aperture can be fed by any of the conventional techniques such as a coaxial cable 11 or a planar microstrip or strip line transmission line to name a few fig1 shows another preferred embodiment where the sfc curves 41 are slotted over a wall of a waveguide 47 of arbitrary cross section this way and slotted waveguide array can be formed with the advantage of the size compressing properties of the sfc curves.',\n","        'may be implemented such a multirange lens is able to alter the peripheral vision and correct astigmatism of the wearer contact lenses such as multirange contact lenses 10 50 and 76 are typically produced as described above by using a transparent material having one refractive index and adjusting curvatures of the zones of the material to form the required different powers transparent materials having variable refractive indices are known in the art such as are used to produce graded index grin lenses and a variable refractive index material may be used to produce a multirange contact lens having powers substantially as described above for lenses 10 50 and 76 all such lenses are assumed to be comprised within the scope of the present invention as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art for any region of a lens using a variable refractive index material the curvature of the zone of the region the base curve and the range and distribution of the refractive index of the material between the zone and the base curve all contribute to the overall power generated for the region it will thus be appreciated that the

numbers p q of given length that are co prime with each other for use in generating electronic keys for the protocol to ensure that the selected numbers are co prime with each other a step of verifying co primeness is performed in the case of a portable electronic device with a microprocessor such as a smart card the test is performed within the card examples of tests for verifying the co primeness are set forth for example in ieee p1363 standard for public key cryptography and in iso iec wd 18032 working draft of apr 18 2001 in practice in the rsa protocol confidentiality of the keys is ensured when the two integer numbers p and q are prime with each other and have a fixed length for example 512 or 1024 bits each typically one of the two numbers q is an integer number that is selected in advance from amongst a set of numbers stored in the microprocessor card the other number p is generated in a random fashion by the microprocessor card when the protocol is to be executed
